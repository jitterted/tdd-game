# JitterTed's TDD Game

This is the online version of JitterTed's TDD Game (buy a copy at https://tdd.cards!), a fun way to learn the [_Predictive Test-Driven Development_ process](https://ted.dev/articles/2021/03/05/clarifying-the-goal-of-behavior-change/) developed by [Ted M. Young](https://ted.dev/about) (aka JitterTed on social media).

## Project Status

This online version of the game is in progress and will likely be available for early access in March/April 2025.

In May 2024, I reset the project and am reimplementing it using HTML and [htmx](https://htmx.org) for the front-end, and Spring Boot & Java on the back-end.

## Watch Me Code

I'm doing almost all the development of the online game live, [on Twitch](https://JitterTed.Stream), with recordings available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBHctPrH7Z2_p472Lko8GmMG7UFAfWGWK).

## Discuss

If you're interested in discussing the code, its architecture, the development process, or the game itself, join us on [JitterTed's Discord](https://ted.dev/discord).

# License

This project is **not** free/open-source, however, the source is being made available under a **Fair Source 2 (0.9)** license (see the License.md file in this directory).
This allows you to see the source, which, as an educator, as I feel is important, but does not allow you to run the game on its own without a paid license, except as defined in the [license](License.md).
