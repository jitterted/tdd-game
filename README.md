# JitterTed's TDD Game

This is the online version of JitterTed's TDD Game (buy a copy at https://tdd.cards!), a fun way to learn the _Predictive Test-Driven Development_ process developed by [Ted M. Young](https://ted.dev/about) (aka JitterTed on social media).

## Project Status

In May, 2024, I reset the project and am reimplementing it using HTML and [htmx](https://htmx.org) for the front-end, and Spring Boot & Java on the back-end.

## Watch Me Code

I'm doing almost all of the development of the online game live, [on Twitch](https://JitterTed.Stream), with recordings available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBHctPrH7Z2_p472Lko8GmMG7UFAfWGWK).
