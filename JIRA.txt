## Cleanup Work
[ ] Get rid of front-end module, make it a single module project

[ ] Remove the idea of an "opponent", games can have anywhere from 1-6 players
[ ] (think) get rid of CardId?
[ ] Separate the Application layer from the Domain
    [ ] Move PORT to application
    [ ] Split out card shuffle (RandomCardShuffler) into PORT and ADAPTER
    [ ] Pull in ArchUnit

## Game Layout

Per Game:
* TILEs
* ACTION CARD DECK
* ACTION CARD DISCARD PILE
* TEST RESULTS DECK
* TEST RESULTS DISCARD PILE
* 6-SIDED DIE

Per Player:
* PAWN (indicates which TILE they're on)
* HAND
* PLAY AREA
* TECH NEGLECT AREA
* COMMIT TRACKER
* RISK TRACKER

Player's "State Machine":
    Player's "TURN" is complete when either: play/discard 3 cards OR explicitly END TURN

## Need

[ ] Structure for the BOARD as 9 separate TILEs,
    [ ] PLAYER is ON a TILE (has a game state machine)
    [ ] player's COMMAND causes change, potentially transition to new TILE
        [ ] MOVE PAWN - moves the player to a new tile
        [ ] DRAW CARD (and DRAW FULL)
        [ ] DISCARD CARD (often causes a transition)
        [ ] PLAY CARD
        [ ] END TURN

## Ubiquitous Language
* Game (deck, card, tile, etc.)
    * Competitive: every person for themselves (1:1 player:pawn)
    * Co-op (mob programming): working together to move pawn forward (N:1 player:pawn)
* Player - ties an Account/Member to a specific game ("player in game")
* Host - part of a Team, they created an instance of a game
* Team - which is an "account-based" thing: who can "see" each other's games and join
* Group - set of players currently playing a specific game (they have all JOINed a specific GAME or are members of the game)
    * one/many PAWN <-> one/many PLAYER (premature)
    * Support variation where GROUP controls single PAWN
* Coach - can observe the game without playing, can control/manipulate game elements
    * "Attached" to one or more TEAMs
* Win Condition (when is the game over)
    * First to 5 commits (or 3 commits, whatever)
    * Timeboxed: most commits within a period of time (duration)
* Game Master view: can see state of game(s) that have been created/in-progress
    * Admin version of this allows manipulation of elements for any reason (not sure if this is different from coach role)
    * Admin can see any game any time
    * Coach can only see games for the TEAMs to which they're attached


## Behavior

1. Host Creates Game (defines competitive or co-op)
2. Player Joins (existing) Game
     * Invited by host, or
     * Chooses available game from team/group
     * If Host wants to play, they have to join too
3. Start Game
    * Decks are shuffled
    * Cards are dealt: 5 to each Player
    * Pawns placed at first TILE
    * Commit tracker set to 0
    * Risk tracker set to 0/0
    * Starting player chosen (proceeds clockwise)
4. Player 1 plays...

## Interaction

[X] 1. Ask for name for new game (start with competitive)
[X] 2. Create game -> provide identifier/link (handle)
[X] 3. Person joins game with human-readable "Handle" (via typing it in, not link)
        [X] Person becomes Player when joined the game
        [X] Multiple different Persons can join the same game
        [X] Constraint: A Person can not join the same game twice, i.e., can't represent TWO Players
            * If a Person joins a game where they are already a player, that is "rejoining" (reconnecting)
        [X] Constraint: 4 players maximum per game (rejoins don't count, of course)
[ ] 4. "start game" is Triggered
    [ ] Action Card deck shuffled, 5 cards dealt to each Player, etc.
    [ ] (Temporary) Constraint: players can't join once game is started

>> [ ] Inbound HTTP Adapter
    [ ] Pseudo-login pick which Person you are (from a list of Pawn colors)
    [ ] Host create game: no textbox (use default game name) and "Create Game" button does POST
    [ ] Person join game: textbox (for handle) and "Join Game" button does POST, redirected to page that connects WebSocket

[ ] Outbound (Notifier) WebSocket Adapter
    [ ] Display name of game, all players, decks, pawns, etc.
