========================

* Struggled with CSS to create the layout for the "Your Hand" section of the Game

* Added shuffling of the discard pile to the draw pile in the Deck, using embedded stub a la Nullables

* Lot of thinking about design around UI Components

* Decided (for now) to use POST for sending commands instead of going through the WebSocket

* Added endpoint for the POST to start game

* Decided to rely on the Game's events (via freshEvents) to check for behavior/state change - this currently causes a test to fail, since we didn't clear freshEvents

* Next time need to properly handle GameStore's find so that we can rely on freshEvents to be cleared when loaded
